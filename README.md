# Microsoft Azure HDInsight Playground

Azure HDInsight is a fully managed, full-spectrum, open-source analytics service for enterprises. HDInsight is a cloud service that makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process massive amounts of data. HDInsight also supports a broad range of scenarios, like extract, transform, and load (ETL); data warehousing; machine learning; and IoT.

Use Azure HDInsight to analyze streaming or historical data.
