# Microsoft Azure HDInsight Playground

Azure HDInsight is a fully managed, full-spectrum, open-source analytics service for enterprises. HDInsight is a cloud service that makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process massive amounts of data. HDInsight also supports a broad range of scenarios, like extract, transform, and load (ETL); data warehousing; machine learning; and IoT.

Use Azure HDInsight to analyze streaming or historical data.

<b>Productivity</b> <BR>
Azure HDInsight enables you to use rich productive tools for Hadoop and Spark with your preferred development environments. These development environments include Visual Studio, VSCode, Eclipse, and IntelliJ for Scala, Python, R, Java, and .NET support. Data scientists can also collaborate using popular notebooks such as Jupyter and Zeppelin.

<b>[Cluster types in HDInsight](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hadoop/apache-hadoop-introduction#cluster-types-in-hdinsight)</b> <BR>
HDInsight includes specific cluster types and cluster customization capabilities, such as the capability to add components, utilities, and languages. HDInsight offers the following cluster types:
* Apache Hadoop: A framework that uses HDFS, YARN resource management, and a simple MapReduce programming model to process and analyze batch data in parallel.
* Apache Spark: An open-source, parallel-processing framework that supports in-memory processing to boost the performance of big-data analysis applications. See What is Apache Spark in HDInsight?.
* Apache HBase: A NoSQL database built on Hadoop that provides random access and strong consistency for large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data--potentially billions of rows times millions of columns. See What is HBase on HDInsight?
* ML Services: A server for hosting and managing parallel, distributed R processes. It provides data scientists, statisticians, and R programmers with on-demand access to scalable, distributed methods of analytics on HDInsight. See Overview of ML Services on HDInsight.
* Apache Storm: A distributed, real-time computation system for processing large streams of data fast. Storm is offered as a managed cluster in HDInsight. See Analyze real-time sensor data using Storm and Hadoop.
* Apache Interactive Query preview (AKA: Live Long and Process): In-memory caching for interactive and faster Hive queries. See Use Interactive Query in HDInsight.
* Apache Kafka: An open-source platform that's used for building streaming data pipelines and applications. Kafka also provides message-queue functionality that allows you to publish and subscribe to data streams. See Introduction to Apache Kafka on HDInsight.


<b>[Open-source components in HDInsight](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hadoop/apache-hadoop-introduction#open-source-components-in-hdinsight)</b> <BR>
Azure HDInsight enables you to create clusters with open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, LLAP, Kafka, Storm, HBase, and R. These clusters, by default, come with other open-source components that are included on the cluster such as Ambari, Avro, Hive, HCatalog, Mahout, MapReduce, YARN, Phoenix, Pig, Sqoop, Tez, Oozie, ZooKeeper.

<b>[Programming languages in HDInsight](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hadoop/apache-hadoop-introduction#programming-languages-in-hdinsight)</b>
